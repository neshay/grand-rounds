                <p>Expressive devices are designed to stand out. Expressive devices combine engineering and fine arts to allow one of a kind socket design. These are devices that allow the user to be able to show off their interests and personality. More commonly in the past generations life-like devices were preferred over expressive devices.  Recently, we are starting to see a shift to more users preferring expressive over life-like devices as many no longer feel societal pressure to hide their device. Having devices where the user can show off their interests and this is especially helpful for user retention in pediatrics as they can place their favourite characters on their device.

            <p>Some users may prefer to have a life-like device that still gives them the opportunity to show off their personality or interests.  Hybrid devices are a cross between life-like devices and expressive devices.  These devices are usually match closely to the user’s skin tone but also have expressive qualities such as tattoos or painted nails.  When designing a device, implementing things such as tattoos or giving the user the option to get their nails painted helps with device retention as it can be a human-like aesthetic quality that still allows them to express themselves.

             <p>Myoelectric devices play a role in cosmesis and help with user retention as it allows the user to fit it with society. The way the device and the user are able to integrate with each other can be classified as a form of cosmesis.  Myoelectric devices are designed to closely mimic natural motions.  Compared to previous technology, newer myoelectric devices are able to closely mimic human movement.  According to <em> Ritchie et al. (2011)</em> it was found that more users prefer electrical cosmetic devices for social outings.  They were especially favoured for social outings especially when the user is looking to fit in with everyday tasks.  The example was given about being able to eat/cut food with coworkers around and not having to ask for help or other noticing
