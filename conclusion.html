                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p> In conclusion when it comes to the acceptance of upper limb devices, cosmesis is an important component of fabrication design. However, how important cosmesis is varies depending on a person’s values and what they hold to be important.  
                    Cosmesis and user retention is a person dependent topic and varies greatly among users. One common theme expressed by respondents in our national survey was that if a patient does not accept the cosmesis of their device, they are less likely to use it. 
                    Clinicians and technicians should communicate with each other along with the patient to assess their values and goals of the device. The amount of emphasis the user places on cosmesis and how closely the device lives up to their expectations is directly related to user retention. As professionals in the field, when fabricating devices, it is important to consider the cosmetic appearance as it can affect the overall retention for individuals wearing upper limb devices

                <h2>Literature Limitations</h2>
                <p>With regards to the literature review; there is limited published data from developing countries, and we would like to see this addressed in future research. We recognize that cosmesis of devices is limited by what patients can afford, and if what they can afford does not satisfy them, this can lead to device rejection. There is also limited data on how demographics influence cosmetic preference (for example, the effect of where patient resides on whether they want to fit in or stand out with their prosthesis), and we would like this gap to be explored more in future studies.

            <h2> Survey Limitations</h2>
    <p>With regards to the survey we acknowledge that this was a Qualitative survey and is not an accurate representation of the whole population as it is not a randomized control trial. Some of the individuals that we sent the survey to had outdated emails on the Orthotics Prosthetics Canada registration website and were not able to respond to our survey. We were also unable to account for non-registered technicians. We recognize that these results may be biased or incomplete results as we have not taken into account the view point of the patients as they are a very important stakeholder ​in the discussion on the impact of cosmesis on retention of devices.
