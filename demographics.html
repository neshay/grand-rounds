    <p> The survey was delivered electronically and distributed to professionals in the field via email.
         The survey included both open-ended and closed-ended questions. We sent the survey to <strong>213</strong> professionals 
         across Canada and received <strong>68</strong> responses, yielding a <strong> 32%</strong>response rate. Through the Orthotics and Prosthetics 
         Canada website, we obtained contact information from professionals and received responses from certified 
         prosthetists, registered prosthetic technicians, dual certified clinicians and technicians, residents and interns.
