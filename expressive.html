                <p>Expressive devices are designed to stand out. Expressive devices combine engineering and fine arts to allow one of a kind socket design. These are devices that allow the user to be able to show off their interests and personality. More commonly in the past generations life-like devices were preferred over expressive devices.  Recently, we are starting to see a shift to more users preferring expressive over life-like devices as many no longer feel societal pressure to hide their device. Having devices where the user can show off their interests and this is especially helpful for user retention in pediatrics as they can place their favourite characters on their device.

                <h2>Personalize Socket</h2>
                <p>One easy and cost effective way to create an expressive device is by personalizing the socket.  This method is commonly offered at many facilities as it is easy to make and relatively inexpensive.  This can be done by adding a printed fabric or custom pattern to the outer layer of the device.  Decals can also be added which are small images printed onto fabric and laminated into the socket.

<p>Currently there are 2 options for interchangeable upper extremity socket covers; magnetic covers and 3D printed covers.  These allow the user the option to change their device pattern or style whenever they would like.

            <p>Open Bionics is a company based in the United Kingdom who created magnetic covers that are able to snap onto their myoelectric devices They have worked with local artists to create various patterns that are offered along with over 50 solid colour options.  They are also currently the only company working with prosthetics that has a license with Disney to make Disney devices such as their Ironman arm or Starwars device.
