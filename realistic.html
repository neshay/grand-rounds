            <h2> Life-like prosthetics attempt to mimic one’s natural body by matching size, shape, colour and texture. </h>
            <p>Certain users may want their prosthesis to look and/or feel as close to an anatomical arm or their sound side as possible which can increase acceptance and help promote a higher wear rate.  Although life-like devices are made to mimic the natural body, prosthetics are inanimate objects and do not change shade or tone based on enviromental factors.  There are many different ways to achieve the a life-like prosthesis with each having their own pros and cons.

            <h2> Endoskeletal Foam</h2>
            <p>Endoskeletal foams tend to have a more realistic feel but are not as durable.  Since the foam is external to the structure, it can easily be damaged with wear. Due to their poor durability, they are less favourable compared to exoskeletal prosthesis

            <h2> Colour of the socket can be achieved by using pre-mixed pigments </h2>
            <p>Pigments come in a variety of different shades and tones or by mixing multiple pigments together for custom tone.  Although we can match the colour of the socket, to the user’s current skin tone, it is important for the user to understand that unlike natural skin which will have slight variations due to various factors (sun exposure, temperature, etc.), the device does not change.

            <h2> PVC Gloves</h2>
            <p> PVC gloves can be used to cover componentry to create a life-like look.  These are especially common over myoelectric hands.  Also, although these are more cost effective than silicone they do not resist soiling or staining very well and are less durable in the long run

            <h2> Custome Silicone </h2>
            <p>  Silicone is becoming more popular but is very expensive.  Although silicone is highly customizable, comfortable and durable.  Developments in silicone to include details such as veins, moles, freckles and hair can further enhance user satisfaction with the prosthesis (Dodson, et al., 2009).
