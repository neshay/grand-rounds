        In your experience, has a patient ever rejected a device due to cosmetic factors? If yes please explain the situation?
    </h4>
    <p class="intro-para"> 
        We were interested in learning about the real-life experiences of treatment care providers in the Prosthetics and Orthotics field, so we explored the topic of device rejection due to device cosmesis in our survey. 
        <br> <br>

        When we asked if patients had ever rejected their devices because of their appearance, we received nearly a 50/50 split from respondents. 51.3% of respondents did have their device rejected by patients due to cosmesis. Some of the reasons for device rejection were shape of device, size of device was too big compared to the contralateral limb, poor colour match to patient’s skin tone and misorientation of the print of the lamination fabric. 
        <br> <br>
        48.7% of respondents said they had never had a patient reject their device due to cosmetic reasons. These individuals indicated some of the following protective factors to device rejection: Setting realistic expectations at the beginning and; building a trusting relationship between the client and the team.

        From your experience does the reason of amputation impact the type of cosmetic finish the patient choses?
    </h4>
    <p class="intro-para"> 
        A gap in the literature that we identified was that there is little to no discussion about the reason for amputation and if that has any impact on the type of cosmetic finish the patient choses.  Nearly 60% of survey respondents said that the type of cosmetic finish does not depend on the reason for amputation, it depends on the individual and their personality. Those who said “yes,  the reason for amputation impacts the type of cosmetic finishing chosen by patients” generally indicated that those with acquired amputations tend to lean towards their prostheses looking more “lifelike” or similar to their lost limb. Those with Congenital amputation may be more accepting of their limb difference so they tend to be more expressive with their choice of cosmetic finishings however this can vary person to person.
